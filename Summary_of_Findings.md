# Summary of Findings

## Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion

This section provides an overview of the central tendency and dispersion measures identified in the dataset. The following variables were analyzed:

- **Age**: Mean age of the patients is calculated and shows a slight skew towards older individuals. The standard deviation indicates variability in the age distribution.
- **Cholesterol**: The median cholesterol level is identified as a suitable measure of central tendency, with a wide range in cholesterol levels as indicated by the IQR.
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: The mean resting blood pressure provides a good central measure, with a relatively small standard deviation, indicating consistent readings across the dataset.

## Association Between Variables

### Categorical Variables
- **Sex vs. Chest Pain Type**: The analysis shows an association between the sex of the patient and the type of chest pain experienced. The results indicate that there are differences in the type of chest pain reported by males and females, which could be relevant in understanding the presentation of heart disease symptoms across genders.
  
### Numerical Variables
- **Age vs. Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)**: The scatter plot demonstrates a relationship between age and resting blood pressure. A moderate correlation is observed, suggesting that as age increases, resting blood pressure tends to increase as well, although the strength of the relationship is not strong.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals several key insights into the factors contributing to heart disease. Age, cholesterol levels, and resting blood pressure are important variables, with significant associations observed between sex and chest pain type. The findings provide a foundation for further research and potential predictive modeling for heart disease risk assessment.
